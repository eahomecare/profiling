      " Hello, can you take the rest of the battery? Yeah, this is customer support. I get a lot of energy for you but I'm not working. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me your order number please? How don't I have any? Yes, it's APK 0804949. Okay, just let me verify that these are the number match with the project you played. Okay, thank you for waiting Mr. Pandit. Now, could you tell me what the problem is? Well, I couldn't get to the outlet but it's not a ring on. Okay, sir. Just to allow this possibility may ask you if other devices are working properly in that outlet? Yes, they are. Well, could you remove the battery and then reconnect it once more time? And I appreciate you can connect it into another outlet. You bet for the ninth time the only is not the problem. Okay, sir. I totally understand your situation and I will feel the same but please calm down, stop yelling me. I'll let you think what I could do for you. Okay? Yeah, yeah, alright. We usually then are proud of it with an extra cable. Could you take a look inside the box and verify it with sent you another? Another cable. Oh, but they're not a cable in the box. Okay, let me see. Oh, so is there a mistake? According to my system, the extra cable was not included. Why have you basically been in this table? I'm so sorry, sir, but this is a specific item. It was at a discount at the moment you purchased it. As a result, we didn't do the extra cable so that we could apply the best price on the device. It's a thing of choice for you for stuff you won't need. Okay, but if you have a lot of trouble going down, don't go to your table. If you want something already one from us, we'll keep you within 24 hours. No, I don't need to do it, guys. Thanks anyway. We're doing your doctor. I will just cut your feedback, my superpixer. Yeah, yeah, alright, right now. How night, sir.\n"
